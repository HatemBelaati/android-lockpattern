Android has one useful tool in security settings, it is Lock Pattern. Users can define their own lock pattern â€’ which is a combination of 4+ dots.

We have extracted this piece of code from Android source code, [platform/frameworks/base](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/com/android/internal/widget/). Then modified it a little, to make it easy to use in an application.

  * **Latest stable: v3.2 (#45)** (January 19th, 2015). _From version `3.1.1 beta (#44)`, this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_versioning#Semantic_versioning)._
  * The demo can be downloaded on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=group.pals.android.lib.ui.lockpattern.demo). It needs some more permissions to help us monetize it. With this service we are able to create more great apps and libraries for you guys. _Thank you for your understanding._
  * Latest source is available in the demo app. You can export it directly to SD card or to Google Drive, Dropbox...
